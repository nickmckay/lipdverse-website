<p>Welcome to the LiPDverse. This website exists to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Help connect you with paleoscience compilation datasets built on in the Linked PaleoData framework.</li>
<li>Visualize, access and edit LiPD datasets easily and flexibly</li>
<li>Be a centralized warehouse and repository for all LiPD datasets, to help simplify data access and reduce redundancy. <em>This third goal is still aspirational, and very much a work in progress</em></li>
</ol>
<p>At present, the websites available here are simple, and not built on a modern web framework. We hope to continue to improve and build out this resource, and <a href="https://github.com/nickmckay/LiPDverse/issues">your suggestions and requests are very welcome.</a> For now, we hope you find this useful.</p>
