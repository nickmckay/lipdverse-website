      <description>Introduction The wNAm database is a collection of Holocene temperature, hydroclimate, and circulation records from western North America. This is a dynamic compilation, meaning that new datasets that meet the criteria for inclusion can be added and included in subsequent versions. See the criteria and data submission sections below for details.
 Data Data access and LiPDverse visualizations are available here.
 Publication A data descriptor for the compilation was published in Earth System Science Data and is available here.</description>

      <description>Introduction The Iso2k database compiled the stable oxygen (\(\delta^{18}O\)) and hydrogen (\(\delta^{2}H\)) isotopic compositions of environmental waters such as precipitation, seawater, lake water, and soil and groundwater, as recorded in a variety of natural archives, including glaciers, ground ice, cave formations, corals, sclerosponges, mollusk shells, tree wood, lake sediments, and marine sediments. This is a dynamic compilation, meaning that new datasets that meet the criteria for inclusion can be added and included in subsequent versions.</description>

      <description>Introduction The PalMod data compilation is a multi-parameter marine palaeoclimate data synthesis that contains time series spanning 0 to 130,000 years ago. The compilation includes only time series for which a robust chronology based on benthic foraminifera \(\delta^{18}O\) and radiocarbon dating is available. Version 1.0.0 of the data product contains 896 time series from 143 individual sites, each associated with rich metadata, ageâ€“depth model ensembles, and information to refine and update the chronologies.</description>

      <description>Introduction The Temperature 12k database was compiled to facilitate the study of multidecadal- to millennial-scale changes in climate over the past 12,000 years. This is a dynamic compilation, meaning that new datasets that meet the criteria for inclusion can be added and included in subsequent versions. See the criteria and data submission sections below for details.

      <description>PAGES 2k Data Coverage   Introduction One of the products of Phase Two of the Pages2k project was this curated data product of temperature reconstructions for the past 2000 years. This is a dynamic compilation, meaning that new datasets that meet the criteria for inclusion can be added and included in subsequent versions. See the criteria and data submission sections below for details.
