<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The PalMod data compilation is a multi-parameter marine palaeoclimate data synthesis that contains time series spanning 0 to 130,000 years ago. The compilation includes only time series for which a robust chronology based on benthic foraminifera <span class="math inline">\(\delta^{18}O\)</span> and radiocarbon dating is available. Version 1.0.0 of the data product contains 896 time series from 143 individual sites, each associated with rich metadata, age–depth model ensembles, and information to refine and update the chronologies. Those 896 timeseries are comprised of 205 benthic foraminifera <span class="math inline">\(\delta^{18}O\)</span> records; 169 of benthic foraminifera <span class="math inline">\(\delta^{13}C\)</span>; 131 of seawater temperature; 174 and 119 of planktonic foraminifera <span class="math inline">\(\delta^{18}O\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\delta^{13}C\)</span>; and 44, 38 and 16 of carbonate, organic carbon and biogenic silica content, respectively.</p>

<h2>Criteria for inclusion</h2>
<p>The complete criteria for inclusion are described in the <a href="https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/12/2261/2020/">manuscript</a>, but in short: To be included in the PalMod compilation, a dataset must meet several criteria:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Marine paleoclimate data comparable with model output</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The high-priority selection includes both physically and biogeochemically relevant parameters, of which some are based on measurements that can be compared with climate model output using (forward proxy) models (e.g. benthic <span class="math inline">\(\delta^{18}O\)</span>) and others represent inferred parameters that can be compared with model output more directly but for which proxy models are still in their infancy (e.g. temperature based on foraminifera Mg∕Ca).</p>

<p class="caption">Included variables</p>
</div>
<p>Only variables listed here were included:</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Record resolution and duration</strong> e prioritized processing time series that we estimated to contain at least 50 data points within the 130,000-year timeframe</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Chronology</strong> , Palmod standardized all chronologies by combining absolute ages (radiocarbon ages, tephra layers and palaeomagnetic events) with <span class="math inline">\(\delta^{18}O\)</span> stratigraphy. As a result, the age models may differ from those reported in the original publication(s). This does not mean that the updated age models are better (constrained), but they are constructed in a way that allows for applicability and consistency across the synthesis. Only datasets that had sufficient <span class="math inline">\(^{14}C\)</span> and benthic <span class="math inline">\(\delta^{18}O\)</span> datasets to develop a robust chronology were included.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Publically archived data</strong> Only datasets that were publicly archived through <a href="https://pangaea.de/">Pangaea</a> or the <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/paleoclimatology">World Data Service for Paleoclimatology</a> <a href="ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/paleo/paleocean//sediment_files/complete">FTP site for marine data</a> were considered for inclusion.</p></li>
